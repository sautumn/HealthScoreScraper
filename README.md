# HealthScoreScraper
Python based web scraper that collects health scores for Jefferson Co. AL and displays them in a sortable format.

### Back End / Web scraper
Uses Beautiful Soup to scrape several webpages from Jefferson County Health Dept (AL) and adds them to a local SQLite database using SQL Alchemy.

### Front End
Built using Flask with Javascript, JQuery, HTML, Bootstrap. Displays database in JSON. Interface allows a user to sort through.

####About
My first attempt at building a web scraper. Made it to teach myself more about web scraping, API's, and databases in general. Definitely has room to improve the speed of the scraper and the front end.
